To resolve the specificity conflict and ensure the expected color is applied, you need to understand and manage CSS specificity:

**Approach 1: Using more specific selectors:**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-div {
  color: red;
}

#id-div {
  color: green;
}

#id-div.special-div {
  color: purple; /* This selector remains the most specific */
}

```

**Approach 2:  CSS Order and !important (Use with caution):**

While generally not recommended except as a last resort, you can use the `!important` flag.  Be aware this can lead to harder-to-maintain CSS.

```css
/* Using !important (generally discouraged) */
#id-div.special-div {
  color: purple !important; /* Overrides other rules */
}
```

The best approach is usually to carefully examine the selectors involved and refactor your styles.  Using more specific selectors (the first approach) is always preferred to using `!important`.
